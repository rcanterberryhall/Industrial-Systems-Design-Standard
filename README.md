# Industrial System Lifecycle Framework
## Hazard-Driven, Drawing-Navigated Engineering for Functional Safety and Commissioning

---

## Why This Framework Exists

Industrial systems are often engineered in fragments.

Hazard analysis is performed, but not structurally embedded into design.  
FMEA is written, but not used to shape architecture.  
PLC software is functional, but not deterministic by design.  
Commissioning is treated as troubleshooting rather than structured validation.  
Proof testing drifts away from its originating failure modes.

The result is predictable: rework, tribal knowledge, inconsistent diagnostics, and commissioning chaos.

This framework exists to eliminate that fragmentation.

## A Different Approach

This methodology defines an integrated lifecycle for industrial systems that unifies:

- Functional Requirements and Design Constraints
- Hazard Analysis
- Safety Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Concept, Preliminary, and Detailed Design (CD / PD / DD)
- Architecture-Level and Detailed FMEA
- Deterministic PLC Software Architecture
- FAT and SAT execution (Functional and Safety)
- Structured Startup & Commissioning Gates
- Proof Testing and Operational Governance

It treats commissioning as part of design.
It treats FMEA as a design instrument.
It treats drawings as the navigation spine of implementation and verification — not the origin of safety intent.
It treats determinism as non-negotiable in control-producing logic.

Functional intent originates upstream: **FR → HA → SRS → FMEA**. This chain defines what the system must do, what hazards threaten that function, what safety integrity is required, and what architecture achieves it — independent of any drawing. Drawings are where that intent is implemented. Once implementation exists, drawing sheet numbers become the navigation key that links FMEA entries, test procedures, software modules, and proof tests into a single traceable system.

## Core Principles

1. **Function defines intent — safety protects it.**
2. **Constraints bound the design space.**
3. **Hazards drive requirements.**
4. **Requirements drive architecture.**
5. **Architecture determines detection capability.**
6. **FMEA drives diagnostic strategy and proof testing.**
7. **Commissioning validates architecture in structured stages.**
8. **Hardware and software are co-designed.**
9. **Actuation must be deterministic.**

These principles are enforced through lifecycle gates, structured documentation, and traceable numbering systems.

## Structural Innovations

This framework introduces practical engineering mechanisms rarely integrated into a single methodology:

- Explicit functional requirements and design constraints as the upstream anchor for hazard analysis and safety requirements. Constraints (regulatory, physical, interface, operational, design standard) are captured alongside requirements — not discovered during construction.
- Drawing sheet numbers as the implementation and verification traceability backbone — linking FMEA entries, FAT/SAT procedures, software modules, and proof tests. Functional and safety requirements originate upstream in the FR, HA, and SRS, independent of sheet structure.
- Explicit CD → PD → DD lifecycle integration with PDR, CDR, and DDR review gates.
- Architecture-level FMEA during Preliminary Design — not after construction.
- Deterministic gateway requirements for all motion-producing logic.
- Startup Gates aligned with bottom-up technical validation levels.
- Explicit handling of Dangerous Undetected (DU) failures and proof test derivation.
- Clear separation of preventive maintenance from safety proof testing.

The result is a lifecycle that is both technically rigorous and field-practical.

## IEC 61511 Alignment Without Bureaucracy

This methodology maps directly to IEC 61511 lifecycle clauses while remaining implementation-focused.

It provides audit traceability without reducing safety engineering to compliance paperwork.

It bridges the gap between regulatory expectation and engineering execution.

## Intended Audience

- Controls Engineers  
- Electrical Engineers  
- Functional Safety Engineers  
- Commissioning Engineers  
- EPC Design Teams  
- Owner-Operators seeking lifecycle discipline

## The Objective

The objective is not documentation volume.

The objective is industrial systems that are:

- Architecturally coherent  
- Diagnosable  
- Deterministic  
- Testable in structured stages  
- Commissioned without rework loops  
- Defensible under audit  

This is not a checklist.

It is an operating system for industrial engineering.
